 * \brief   2021 Allhallowtide HT16D35A driver.
 * \brief   LED controller driver for the HT16D35A, for use in the 2021
 *          Allhallowtide badge. This driver handles the low-level interaction
 *          with the LED controller itself; the application-level animations
 *          are left to different code.
